# Frontend Automatic Edge Sync Tasks

This file tracks the tasks required to ensure that automatically created edges in the backend are reflected on the frontend without requiring a manual refresh.

## Task List

- [X] **Implement Frontend Refetch After Note Creation:**
    - [X] Locate the frontend code responsible for handling the successful creation of a new note (Found in `SidePanel.tsx` -> `handleCreateNote`).
    - [X] Identify the function used to fetch all graph data (Found in `graphStore.ts` -> `fetchGraphData`).
    - [X] Add a call to this fetch function immediately after the note creation API call returns successfully (Added `await fetchGraphData()` in `SidePanel.tsx`).
