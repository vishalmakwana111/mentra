# Summary of Completed Automatic Edge Creation Tasks

This document summarizes the tasks completed to implement and debug the automatic creation of edges between similar notes.

## Completed Tasks:

1.  **Define Similarity Threshold:**
    *   Decided on a minimum similarity score (0.75).
    *   Added `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` setting to `app/core/config.py`.
    *   Instructed user to add `SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.75` to `.env`.

2.  **Implement Backend Edge Creation Logic:**
    *   Modified `create_note` in `app/crud/crud_note.py` to trigger similarity search after successful note/node commit.
    *   Created helper function `_find_and_create_similar_note_edges` within `crud_note.py`.
    *   Implemented logic within the helper to call `query_similar_notes` using the new note's content.
    *   Added filtering of search results (exclude self, apply threshold).
    *   Implemented logic to fetch the target node's `graph_node_id`.
    *   Called `crud_graph.create_graph_edge` to create the edge in the database.
    *   Corrected the `create_graph_edge` call to use the `GraphEdgeCreate` schema object.
    *   Debugged and fixed `TypeError` by using the correct keyword argument (`edge=`) when calling `crud_graph.create_graph_edge`.
    *   Added logging throughout the edge creation process.

3.  **Refine Similarity Search for User Specificity:**
    *   Modified `query_similar_notes` in `app/ai/vectorstore.py` to accept and filter by `user_id`.
    *   Updated the call in `_find_and_create_similar_note_edges` (`crud_note.py`) to pass the `user_id`.
    *   Updated the search endpoint (`/search-notes` in `app/api/api_v1/endpoints/ai.py`) to require authentication and pass the `user_id` to `query_similar_notes`.

4.  **Fix Node Position Handling & API Errors:**
    *   Debugged `ResponseValidationError` occurring during `GET /api/v1/graph/nodes/`.
    *   Updated `GraphNode` response schema (`app/schemas/graph.py`) to make `position_x`/`position_y` optional using `@computed_field` to handle potential `None` values from DB gracefully.
    *   Modified `create_graph_node` and `update_graph_node` in `app/crud/crud_graph.py` to ensure the `position` column in the database always stores `{"x": 0.0, "y": 0.0}` by default if coordinates are missing or invalid, preventing `null` values within the JSON.
    *   Refined `GraphNodeInDBBase` schema (`app/schemas/graph.py`) to use `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` for `position` to robustly handle potentially malformed legacy data during initial load.

5.  **Implement Frontend Update for Edge Visibility:**
    *   Located the note creation handling logic in the frontend (`SidePanel.tsx`).
    *   Identified the graph data fetching function (`fetchGraphData` in `graphStore.ts`).
    *   Modified `SidePanel.tsx` to call `fetchGraphData` after a note is successfully created via the API.
