# Notes Loading Debug Tasks

This file tracks tasks related to debugging why notes are not appearing in the side panel.

1.  **Check Frontend Console Logs**
    - [x] Open browser console (F12).
    - [x] Refresh the `/dashboard` page.
    - [x] Check for any errors related to `/api/v1/notes/`, `fetchNotes`, or `loadNotes`.

2.  **Add Frontend Component Logging**
    - [x] In `SidePanel.tsx` -> `loadNotes` function, add `console.log('Fetched Notes:', fetchedNotes);` before `setNotes(fetchedNotes);`.
    - [x] In `NoteList.tsx`, add `console.log('NoteList received notes:', notes);` at the beginning of the component function.

3.  **Verify API Request/Response**
    - [x] In `api.ts` -> Axios request interceptor, modify the logging to show token attachment for `/notes/` requests as well.
    - [x] In `api.ts` -> `fetchNotes` function, add detailed logging in the `catch` block similar to `getCurrentUser` to see specific Axios error details (status, data).

4.  **Check Backend Logs**
    - [x] Check the terminal where the backend (Uvicorn) server is running.
    - [x] Look for any errors related to the `GET /api/v1/notes/` endpoint when the dashboard loads.

5.  **Analyze and Fix**
    - [x] Analyze the collected logs from frontend and backend.
    - [x] Identify the root cause (State update timing: `setUser` wasn't setting `isLoggedIn`, causing `loadNotes` to fail on refresh due to incorrect dependency check).
    - [x] Implement the necessary fix (Modified `setUser` in `authStore.ts`).
