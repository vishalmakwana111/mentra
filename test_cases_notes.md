# Note Creation Test Cases

Here are 5 test cases for creating notes, including title, summary, and content.

**Test Case 1: Basic React Concept**

* **Title:** React Components
* **Summary:** Components are reusable UI pieces in React.
* **Content:** React applications are built using components, which are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render function. Components can be class-based or function-based.

**Test Case 2: State Management Comparison**

* **Title:** Zustand vs Redux Toolkit
* **Summary:** Comparing Zustand (simple) and Redux Toolkit (structured) for React state.
* **Content:** Zustand offers a minimal, hook-based approach to global state management in React, requiring less boilerplate than traditional Redux. Redux Toolkit, however, provides a more opinionated and structured way to manage state with actions, reducers, and a centralized store, which can be beneficial for larger applications.

**Test Case 3: Backend Framework**

* **Title:** FastAPI Introduction
* **Summary:** FastAPI is a modern Python web framework for APIs.
* **Content:** FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Key features include automatic data validation, interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc), and dependency injection.

**Test Case 4: Database Concept**

* **Title:** SQL Indexing
* **Summary:** Indexes speed up database query performance.
* **Content:** Database indexes are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval operations. Simply put, an index is a pointer to data in a table. An index in a database is very similar to an index in the back of a book. Common types include B-tree and Hash indexes.

**Test Case 5: General Programming Concept**

* **Title:** Asynchronous Programming
* **Summary:** Async programming allows non-blocking operations.
* **Content:** Asynchronous programming allows a program to start a potentially long-running task and still be able to be responsive to other events while that task runs, rather than having to wait until that task has finished. Common patterns include callbacks, Promises (in JavaScript), and async/await syntax in languages like Python and JavaScript.
